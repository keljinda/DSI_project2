**A regression challenge** designed to test your understanding of the topics you learned in class while putting you to the test using actual, messy, and huge data.    In this project, a regression model that forecasts the cost of a house in Bangkok using data on housing prices that gives an ability to make data science decisions will be tested because the data contains many aspects.**Lasso regression** is an effective tool for building predictive models, particularly in scenarios with many features or potential overfitting concerns. Its combination of regularization and automatic feature selection makes it a preferred choice in many applications, especially when model interpretability is important.In this project, the metric used to evaluate your model is **root mean squared error (RMSE)**. and the Lasso model gets the best score when compared with OLS and RANSAC(Random Sample Consensus).All calculation aim to answer question from Which property characteristics and market conditions have the greatest impact on current residential housing prices in Bangkok, to help homebuyers and property investors make informed investment decisions?
